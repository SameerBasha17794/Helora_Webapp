  <div class="col-md-6">
     
	 <div class="col-md-12"><button class="accordion">How do I decide on my fee structure?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You establish your pricing based on the procedure.  Healora suggests medicare + 20%. Healora will provide the CPT codes and medicare pricing so you will have a reference point.  The more competitive your fees are, the faster your Direct Pay practice should grow. The sweet spot seems to be medicare + 20%. Remember that this is paid at the time of service. There is no balance billing or collections. Administrative costs associated with activities such as billing, producing insurance claim forms, coding diagnoses and procedures, referrals, authorizations, payment delays, EOB reviews, claim denials, re-submissions, collection risks, and other “managed care” costs are all eliminated.  You can provide patients a fair price for services without the administrative hassles and bureaucracy. You have the legal right to charge a reduced rate for a particular medical service based on a “prompt pay.” You may change your pricing up or down at any time. Your price stays hidden from the public. Only our registered members see your specific pricing just like your other payor contracts.  </p>
</div></div>
	 <div class="col-md-12">
<button class="accordion">How does Healora help me attract new patients?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The primary driver is cost. Healora provides a platform to compare cost. This lets physicians share their cash price with our direct pay member organization. These patients know they are receiving a fair price by paying in full at the time you deliver your services. To strengthen market recognition you may include the Healora logo in your advertisements so potential customers can register and review your cash pricing.  Call us so that we can help.</p>
</div></div>
	 <div class="col-md-12">

<button class="accordion">How should I “code” services for Healora patients?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Coding or description of services is up to you. To distinguish Healora patients from others, we recommend using the prefix H in your notes. This simple approach will save you time, avoid confusion, and reduce your legal exposure for accidentally miss-coding a service.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="col-md-6">
     
	 <div class="col-md-12">
<button class="accordion">Can I let my patients know about Healora?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes, if you want your patients to pay cash at the time of service.  Healora is a soft transition to cash for your practice and it offers a good intermediary choice to reduce the administrative burden of collecting from insurance and balance billing as well as cash negotiation with the patient.  Ask about our office placards with your custom promo-coded cards.</p>
</div>
</div>
	 <div class="col-md-12">
<button class="accordion">How does Healora protect against no-shows?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>At your option, when the patient calls for the appointment you can require a $50 hold be placed on the patient’s credit card. The patient will understand that a spot has been reserved at a low rate and if they do not show up or call 24 hours prior to the appointment they will forfeit the $50.</p>
</div></div>
	 <div class="col-md-12">
  

<button class="accordion">How do I enroll with Healora?   </button>

  <div class="col-md-6">
     
	 <div class="col-md-12">
  
<button class="accordion">Who put the prices in there?  </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The doctors.  Healora does not dictate pricing, however, our network of direct pay members gives a powerful incentive for doctors to provide fair and reasonable pricing.  Also, by paying direct prior to service it removes up to 70% of the administrative costs of procedures. </p>
</div></div>
	 <div class="col-md-12">
<button class="accordion">Do you work with Primary Care Centers? </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes.  Primary Care Doctors refer many of their patients to the Healora network of direct pay specialty physicians.</p>

</div>
	 <div class="col-md-12">

<button class="accordion">How does it work with hospitals?  </button>
<div class="panel">
